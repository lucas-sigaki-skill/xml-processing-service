# Detailed Implementation Plan

This solution consists of two projects written in .NET Core 8: a Windows Service for XML file processing and a Windows Forms application for configuration, service control, and log display.

---

## 1. Windows Service Project (e.g. "XmlProcessingService")

### File: Program.cs
- **Purpose:** Entry point for the service.
- **Changes/Steps:**
  - Use Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting to create and configure the host.
  - Add support for Windows Service integration.
  - Load configuration from an appsettings.json file.
- **Error Handling:** Catch unexpected errors during host build/start.

### File: XmlFileWatcherService.cs
- **Purpose:** Implements the background service that monitors the configured folder.
- **Changes/Steps:**
  - Inherit from BackgroundService.
  - On startup, perform an initial scan of the folder (read from configuration).
  - Instantiate a System.IO.FileSystemWatcher to monitor folder changes.
  - Subscribe to Created/Changed events.
- **Error Handling:** Wrap file operations in try-catch and log any filesystem exceptions.

### File: XmlProcessor.cs
- **Purpose:** Encapsulate logic to parse XML files and import data.
- **Steps:**
  - Load the XML file using XDocument.
  - Detect XML type:
    - **NFCe**: Check for `<nfeProc>` root element with `<NFe>` child
    - **SAT CFe**: Check for `<CFe>` root element with `<infCFe>` child
  - Extract key data based on XML type:
    - **NFCe**: Extract from `<infNFe>`, `<emit>`, `<det>`, `<total>`, `<pag>` sections
    - **SAT CFe**: Extract from `<infCFe>`, `<emit>`, `<det>`, `<total>`, `<pgto>` sections
  - Prepare sample INSERT statements for both XML types with different table structures.
  - Call the DB utility (see DbHelper.cs) to execute an INSERT.
  - Return a Boolean indicating success or failure.
- **Error Handling:** Use try-catch for XML parsing and data extraction. Log details and return an error flag.

### File: DbHelper.cs
- **Purpose:** Manage database operations with either MSSQL or HANA.
- **Steps:**
  - Read the connection string and database type from the configuration.
  - Use ADO.NET to open a connection and execute a parameterized INSERT query.
  - Create sample table structures for both XML types:
    - **NFCe_Documents**: Store NFCe header info (CNPJ, emission date, total value, etc.)
    - **SAT_CFe_Documents**: Store SAT CFe header info (CNPJ, emission date, total value, etc.)
    - **Document_Items**: Store line items from both XML types with XML type indicator
  - Implement methods for both MSSQL Server and SAP HANA syntax differences.
- **Error Handling:** Catch SQL exceptions, log error details, and return false on failure.

### File: appsettings.json
- **Purpose:** Store service configuration settings.
- **Contents:**
  - "WatchFolder": Folder path to scan for XML files.
  - "ProcessedFolder": Destination folder for successfully processed files.
  - "ErrorFolder": Destination folder for files that fail processing.
  - "DbConnectionString": Connection string (configured later via Forms app).
  - "DatabaseType": e.g. "MSSQL" or "HANA".
- **Best Practices:** Validate the existence of folder paths on startup.

## 2. Windows Forms Application Project (e.g. "ServiceManagerApp")

### File: Program.cs
- **Purpose:** Launch the Windows Forms UI.
- **Changes/Steps:**
  - Set up single instance behavior.
  - Initialize application settings and load any saved configuration.

### File: MainForm.cs
- **Purpose:** Main UI for configuration, service control, and log viewing.
- **UI Elements:**
  - **Configuration Panel:** Input fields for "Watch Folder", "Processed Folder", "Error Folder", "DB Connection String", and a drop-down for "Database Type". Use modern typography, spacing, and color to create a clean layout.
  - **Service Control Buttons:** Buttons labeled “Install”, “Uninstall”, “Start”, and “Stop”. These buttons will execute service control commands via the ServiceControllerHelper.
  - **Log Display:** A read-only multiline TextBox or ListView showing log entries, with clear labels and spacing.
  - **Tray Integration:** On minimize, the window hides and a system tray icon is configured with double-click to restore. (Do not use external icons; use a basic custom painted icon if needed.)
- **Steps:**
  - Implement Save/Load configuration functionality (store settings in a JSON file or user settings file).
  - Wire up buttons to invoke service operations.
  - Periodically update the log display with latest log entries.
- **Error Handling:** Validate user inputs, show message boxes for errors, and catch exceptions during service control operations.

### File: ServiceControllerHelper.cs
- **Purpose:** Interface to install, uninstall, start, and stop the Windows Service.
- **Steps:**
  - Use Process.Start to run sc.exe commands or use the ServiceController class once the service is installed.
  - Implement methods:
    - InstallService
    - UninstallService
    - StartService
    - StopService
- **Error Handling:** Check command exit codes and catch exceptions, then display user-friendly errors.

## 3. Integration and Best Practices

- **Configuration Sharing:** Both projects use the same configuration structure. The Windows Forms app saves settings that the service reads from appsettings.json.
- **Logging:** 
  - In the service, logs are written to a log file (e.g., "service.log").
  - The Windows Forms app reads the log file periodically and updates the UI.
- **File Operations:** 
  - After processing, the XML file is moved to either the Processed or Error folder.
  - Use robust file locking and verify that files are no longer in use before moving.
- **Testing:** 
  - Simulate folder changes and verify that FileSystemWatcher picks up new XML files.
  - Run through scenarios where XML parsing fails or the database insertion fails.
  - Validate that service control commands work correctly via the Forms app.

## Summary

• Create a .NET Core 8 Windows Service to monitor a folder, process XML files, import data to a sample MSSQL/HANA table, and move files based on the result.  
• Implement core files: Program.cs, XmlFileWatcherService.cs, XmlProcessor.cs, DbHelper.cs, and appsettings.json with robust error handling.  
• Develop a Windows Forms application for configuration, service installation/uninstallation, control, and logging.  
• Provide a modern, clean UI using only standard typography, colors, spacing, and layout with tray integration.  
• Utilize service control via ServiceControllerHelper and shared configuration storage for seamless integration between projects.
